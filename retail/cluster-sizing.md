## General OpenShift Minimum Requirements

OpenShift 4 has the following minimum requirements for sizing of nodes:

* **Minimum 4 vCPU** (additional are strongly recommended).
* **Minimum 16 GB RAM** (additional memory is strongly recommended, especially if etcd is colocated on masters).
* **Minimum 40 GB** hard disk space for the file system containing /var/.
* **Minimum 1 GB** hard disk space for the file system containing /usr/local/bin/.

There are several applications that comprise the **retail** pattern.  In addition, the **retail** pattern also includes a number of supporting operators that are installed by **OpenShift GitOps** using ArgoCD.

### retail Pattern OpenShift Datacenter HUB Cluster Size

The retail pattern has been tested with a defined set of specifically tested configurations that represent the most common combinations that Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) customers are using or deploying for the x86_64 architecture.

The Datacenter HUB OpenShift Cluster is made up of the the following on the AWS deployment tested:

| Node Type | Number of nodes | Cloud Provider | Instance Type
| :---- | :----: | :---- | :----
| Master | 3 | Amazon Web Services | m5.xlarge
| Worker | 4 | Amazon Web Services | m5.xlarge

The Datacenter HUB OpenShift cluster needs to be a bit bigger than the Factory/Edge clusters because this is where the developers will be running pipelines to build and deploy the **Industrial Edge** pattern on the cluster.  The above cluster sizing is close to a **minimum** size for a Datacenter HUB cluster.  In the next few sections we take some snapshots of the cluster utilization while the **Industrial Edge** pattern is running.  Keep in mind that resources will have to be added as more developers are working building their applications.

#### Hub Cluster utilization

Below is a snapshot of the OpenShift cluster utilization while running the **retail** pattern:

| CPU | Memory |  File System |  Network | Pod Count
| :----: | :-----: | :----: | :----: | :----:
| `13.84` **Used 42.16 available of 56** | `73.5 GiB` **146.3 GiB available of 219.8 GiB** | `106 GiB` **732.9 GiB available of 838.9 GiB** | `20.65` **MBps in** `22.84` **MBps out** | `354` **pods**

### Retail Pattern OpenShift Store Edge Cluster Size

The OpenShift cluster is made of 3 Nodes combining Master/Workers for the Edge/Factory cluster.

| Node Type | Number of nodes | Cloud Provider | Instance Type
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----:
| Master/Worker | 3 | Google Cloud | n1-standard-8
| Master/Worker | 3 | Amazon Cloud Services | m5.2xlarge
| Master/Worker | 3 | Microsoft Azure | Standard_D8s_v3

#### Store Cluster Utilization

### AWS Instance Types

The **retail** pattern was tested with the highlighted AWS instances in **bold**.   The OpenShift installer will let you know if the instance type meets the minimum requirements for a cluster.

The message that the openshift installer will give you will be similar to this message

```text
INFO Credentials loaded from default AWS environment variables
FATAL failed to fetch Metadata: failed to load asset "Install Config": [controlPlane.platform.aws.type: Invalid value: "m4.large": instance type does not meet minimum resource requirements of 4 vCPUs, controlPlane.platform.aws.type: Invalid value: "m4.large": instance type does not meet minimum resource requirements of 16384 MiB Memory]
```

Below you can find a list of the AWS instance types that can be used to deploy the **retail** pattern.

| Instance type | Default vCPUs | Memory (GiB) | Datacenter | Factory/Edge
| :------: | :-----: | :-----: | :----: | :----:
| | | | 3x3 OCP Cluster | 3 Node OCP Cluster
| m4.xlarge   | 4  | 16 | N | N
| **m4.2xlarge**  | 8  | 32 | Y | Y
| m4.4xlarge  | 16 | 64 | Y | Y
| m4.10xlarge | 40 | 160 | Y | Y
| m4.16xlarge | 64 | 256 | Y | Y
| **m5.xlarge**   | 4  | 16 | Y | N
| **m5.2xlarge**  | 8  | 32 | Y | Y
| m5.4xlarge  | 16 | 64 | Y | Y
| m5.8xlarge  | 32 | 128 | Y | Y
| m5.12xlarge | 48 | 192 | Y | Y
| m5.16xlarge | 64 | 256 | Y | Y
| m5.24xlarge | 96 | 384 | Y | Y

The OpenShift cluster is made of 4 Masters and 3 Workers for the Datacenter and the Edge/Factory cluster are made of 3 Master/Worker nodes.  For the node sizes we used the **m5.xlarge** on AWS and this instance type met the minimum requirements to deploy the **retail** pattern successfully on the Datacenter hub.  On the Factory/Edge cluster we used the **m5.2xlarge** since the minimum cluster was comprised of 3 nodes.  .

To understand better what types of nodes you can use on other Cloud Providers we provide some of the details below.

### Azure Instance Types

The **retail** pattern was also deployed on Azure using the **Standard_D8s_v3** VM size.  Below is a table of different VM sizes available for Azure.  Keep in mind that due to limited access to Azure we only used the **Standard_D8s_v3** VM size.
