taking credit for their work.</p><p>Where there is an existing application/demo, there is also a strong preference
for the originating team to own any changes that are needed for the
implementation to become a validated pattern. Alternatively, if the Validated
Patterns team drives the conversion, then in order to prevent confusion and
duplicated efforts, we are likely to ask for a commitment to phase out use of
the previous implementation for future engagements such as demos, presentations,
and workshops.</p><p>The goal is to avoid bringing a parallel implementation into existence which
divides Red Hat resources, and creates confusion internally and with customers
as the implementations drift apart.</p><p>In both scenarios the originating team can choose where to host the primary
repository, will be given admin permissions to any fork in
<a href=https://github.com/hybrid-cloud-patterns>https://github.com/hybrid-cloud-patterns</a>,

Additional components in a Validated Pattern that are not supported by Red Hat (e.g. Hashicorp Vault, and Seldon Core) will require a customer to obtain support from that vendor directly.
The validated patterns team is very motivated to address any problems in the VP Operator, as well as problems in the common helm charts, but cannot not offer any SLAs at this time.
